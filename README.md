It is difficult to map out the entire prison 'industry' that generates more revenue than the combined GDP of 133 countries. This work in progress will show how law enforcement enforces crime, the system, and revenue. They do not protect us except as a means to fulfil enforcing one or all three of those things. i fact I submit that they prey upon us. Fish in a fucking barrel.
