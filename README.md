It is difficult to map out the entire american prison 'industry' that generates more revenue than the combined GDP of 133 countries. This work in progress will show how law enforcement enforces crime, the system, and revenue. They do not protect us except as a means to fulfill enforcing one or all three of those things. They exploit, they do not protect. I submit that they prey upon us like fish in a fucking barrel.
