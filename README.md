It is difficult to map out the entire american prison 'industry' that generates more revenue than the combined GDP of 133 countries. This work in progress will show how law enforcement enforces crime, the system, and revenue. They do not protect us except as a means to fulfill enforcing the system. The united states should be indicted under its own RICO act:

EXTORTION: Demanding money and punishing you if you do not pay, yet calling it ‘protection’ is extortion which is mafia behavior. Even if they try to justify it with ‘crime’ and wording because you went 65 in a 55. When money and then jail is the method of enforcement it only punishes the poor. Pay to go free in this corporate oligarchical plutocracy. Crimi…I mean citizens either get public defenders who are swamped or paid attorneys that can choose cases and dedicate time required. Regardless, all attorneys are officers of the court. They talk, eat, and gossip together.

GAMBLING: The lottery is self explanatory. You can play the numbers but only the state sanctioned ones where they control the revenue.

ROBBERY: For years running police have stolen more than burglars have. Another reason why those that worship the boot should be incarcerated with them.

MURDER: Police kill people in the street. Weaponless people. For cigarettes and other minor things.

TRAFFICKING: The united states is one of the only countries with direct to consumer pharmaceutical advertising. The state doesn’t give a fuck if you do drugs, the state just wants you to do their profiteering drugs. Our lives are corporate laboratories.

WITNESS TAMPERING: Offer someone who is afraid and looking at 10+ years in prison their freedom and some money – some 7 or 8 out of 10 people will throw their dealer under the bus on their drug cases. If there were no incentive, many would never do it, this means that the witnesses are tempted and manipulated into speaking things.

KIDNAPPING: Taking people to a concrete and steel box and only releasing them if they can pay? How in the goddamn fuck is that not kidnapping for ransom? This happens every day because people drove their own vehicles without paying the state first.
